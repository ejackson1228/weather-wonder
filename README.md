Description: 
This web application is a weather dashboard that serves the purpose of helping people plan out potential vacations. By using a third-party API (OpenWeatherAPI), the application is able to show the current weather and 5-day forecast of a given city. Using local storage, users are also able to save and view previous searches. Please note: in order to view your most recent  searches, please refresh the page. This application is still a WIP with greater potential than the current version. However, this is a minimum viable product as of the time this description is being written.
